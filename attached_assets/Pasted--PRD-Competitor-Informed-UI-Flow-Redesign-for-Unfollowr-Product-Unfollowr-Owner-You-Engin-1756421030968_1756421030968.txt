1. Objective

Leverage competitive insights from UnfollowCheck (direct category competitor) and Cluely (UI/UX polish inspiration) to:
	•	Refine homepage flow (emotional CTA, immediate upload).
	•	Reimagine results page layout (clean, segmented, interactive like UnfollowCheck).
	•	Enhance UI polish (transparency, gradients, minimalism from Cluely).
	•	Provide trust signals (privacy-first vs. paid competitors).

⸻

2. Competitor Learnings

From UnfollowCheck ￼
	•	Clear categories: “New Followers,” “Unfollowers,” “Too-Famous-To-Follow,” “Inner Circle,” “Fan Club.”
	•	Direct flow: “Download → Upload → Instantly see results.”
	•	Strong CTAs: “Reveal all Instagram unfollowers,” “Start 14-day free trial.”
	•	Social proof: “Trusted by 10k+ users,” Product Hunt badge.
	•	Trust messaging: “No Instagram password required, 100% safe.”
	•	Monetization wall: Free trial → paid subscription.

From Cluely ￼
	•	Aesthetic: glassmorphism, soft shadows, gradient text, hover animations.
	•	Hierarchy: Hero headline + immediate CTA.
	•	Interactive storytelling: “Scroll to see it in action.”
	•	Credibility: Enterprise security badges (SOC2, GDPR, etc.).
	•	Micro-interactions: hover lifts, smooth transitions, animated badges.
	•	Human-centric messaging: conversational copy (“Thinking is the slowest thing you do”).

3. Unfollowr Strategy (Differentiators)
	•	Privacy-first: Local-first, no login, no trial wall.
	•	Free baseline: Always free for core “who doesn’t follow back.”
	•	AI assistant: Unique to Unfollowr → natural-language filters.
	•	Polished but honest: Credibility without inflated numbers.

4. Feature & UI Requirements

A) Homepage
	•	Hero
	•	Headline: “Find out who’s not following back.”
	•	Subcopy: “Upload your Instagram export — discover unfollowers instantly. 100% private.”
	•	CTA: Upload my export (scrolls to upload box).
	•	Upload Section (near top)
	•	Large glassy card with drag/drop animation.
	•	Progress bar (Cluely-style smooth line, not spinner).
	•	Privacy badge: “🔒 Files never leave your device.”
	•	Social Proof
	•	Banner: “Hundreds of exports analyzed daily.”
	•	Placeholder badges (Product Hunt, Indie Hackers).
	•	Trust Section
	•	Privacy-first messaging.
	•	Optional “Why safer than other apps?” comparison (vs UnfollowCheck’s paywall model).

B) Results Page
	•	Header Stats
	•	Cards: Followers, Following, Non-followers, Ratio.
	•	Style: white glass cards, hover lift (Cluely polish).
	•	Categories (UnfollowCheck style)

	•	New Followers
	•	Unfollowers
	•	Not Following Back (Too Famous)
	•	Inner Circle
	•	Fan Club
	•	Filter Bar
	•	Alphabetical chips (scrollable on mobile).
	•	Advanced filter button (segments, inactivity, suggestion score).
	•	AI Assistant Integration
	•	Floating chat bubble (mobile).
	•	Button in header bar (desktop).
	•	Suggested queries: “Hide celebrities,” “Show real friends.”
	•	Grid & Table Views
	•	Grid: hover highlight, username + profile link.
	•	Table: alternating row colors, hover action icons.
	•	Empty States
	•	Example: “🎉 No one fits that filter. Try resetting.”

⸻

C) Cross-Platform Polish
	•	Typography: match homepage (bold headers, muted gray subtext).
	•	Colors: stick to Unfollowr blue, with subtle gradients for depth.
	•	Icons: Lucide set for consistency.
	•	Animations: Framer Motion for section fade/slide, hover lift.
	•	Mobile: sticky bottom bar for batch actions (Copy, Export).

⸻

D) Admin Dashboard (Internal)

From competitor cues, track:
	•	Total uploads
	•	Sessions (DAU/MAU)
	•	AI queries usage
	•	Most-used categories (Unfollowers, Not Following Back, etc.)
	•	System health: average file size, success rate, error counts.

5. Technical Requirements
	•	Stack: Next.js + Tailwind + Framer Motion + Supabase.
	•	State management: Context/Zustand for dataset + filters.
	•	Data privacy: Client-side parsing only; AI queries send snippets only (bios/usernames).
	•	Accessibility: All filters/buttons keyboard + screen reader friendly.
	•	Performance: Lighthouse Perf ≥ 90; CLS < 0.05.

6. Deliverables
	•	New homepage (upload-first, social proof, privacy).
	•	Results page redesign with categories, filters, AI assistant.
	•	Responsive mobile-first layouts.

	•	Emphasize privacy-first vs competitor’s trial/paywall model.
	•	Combine Cluely’s polish with UnfollowCheck’s categorization.
