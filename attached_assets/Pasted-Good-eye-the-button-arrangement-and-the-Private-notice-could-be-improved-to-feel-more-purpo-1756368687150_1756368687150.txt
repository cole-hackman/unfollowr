Good eye üëÄ ‚Äî the button arrangement and the ‚ÄúPrivate‚Äù notice could be improved to feel more **purposeful, consistent, and visually balanced**. Right now it feels slightly scattered and the green badge breaks the otherwise **blue-first identity** of your UI.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôd recommend:

---

## üîÑ Button Placement & Hierarchy

### Current layout

* Disabled **Analyze** button on far left
* **Try with sample files** in the middle
* **Clear all** on the far right

This creates a **neutral row** with no clear visual priority.

---

### Improved layout

Group buttons into **primary vs secondary actions**:

1. **Primary action** (blue, large):

   * `Analyze non-followers`
   * Always on the **right side** (consistent with "next/forward" patterns).
   * Becomes enabled after files uploaded.

2. **Secondary actions** (ghost/outlined, smaller):

   * `Try with sample files`
   * `Clear all`

   ‚Üí These should sit **left of the primary button**, grouped together.

---

### Suggested arrangement

```
[ Try with sample files ]   [ Clear all ]      [ Analyze non-followers ]
```

* Primary CTA (‚ÄúAnalyze‚Äù) is **right-aligned** and dominant.
* Supportive options stay grouped together on the left.
* Keeps user flow clear: "experiment or reset ‚Üí confirm action."

## üîí Privacy Notice Restyle

* Instead of green (which looks like success/confirmation), make it **blue** (same shade as your UI: #2563EB).
* Icon: lock or shield in outline style, blue.
* Background: soft blue tint (`bg-blue-50`).
* Text: darker blue (`text-blue-700`).

### Example (Tailwind-ish):

```html
<div class="flex items-center gap-2 rounded-lg bg-blue-50 text-blue-700 px-3 py-2 text-sm font-medium">
  <svg class="w-4 h-4 text-blue-600" .../> 
  Private: Files never leave your device without your consent.
</div>
```

## ‚ú® Why this works

* **Consistency**: uses your brand blue, not green.
* **Clarity**: users instantly know the main action is "Analyze."
* **Hierarchy**: support actions feel optional; primary CTA is prominent.
* **Alignment with best practices**: mirrors common SaaS upload flows.

Do you want me to **mock this up visually** (side-by-side with current) so your SWE can immediately see how the buttons + notice should look, or just provide Tailwind/React snippets for implementation?
