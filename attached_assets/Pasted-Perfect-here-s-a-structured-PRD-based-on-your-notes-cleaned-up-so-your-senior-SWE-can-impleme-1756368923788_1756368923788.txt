Perfect — here’s a **structured PRD** based on your notes, cleaned up so your senior SWE can implement without ambiguity.

# 📄 PRD – Homepage, Results Page, Mobile, and Branding Improvements

**Product:** Unfollowr
**Owner:** \[You]
**Engineering:** \[Senior SWE]
**Date:** \[Today’s Date]

---

## 1. Objective

Improve **homepage clarity, user engagement, and trust** while making the **results page more interactive and fun**. Ensure the experience works seamlessly on **mobile** and polish branding/UI for a consistent, modern feel.

---

## 2. Scope

### In Scope

* Homepage CTA and upload experience
* Results page empty states, batch actions, micro-interactions
* Mobile responsiveness + floating CTAs
* Branding polish (logo animation, icon consistency, gradients)

### Out of Scope

* Backend changes to data analysis
* AI model modifications (only UI/UX presentation improvements here)

---

## 3. Features & Requirements

### 🔎 Homepage

**Hero Section (CTA optimization)**

* Replace “Analyze my Instagram” with:

  * **Primary CTA:** “Find out who’s not following back”
  * **Alternative CTA (optional A/B):** “See who you should unfollow”
* Ensure CTA text is responsive (no wrapping on mobile).

**Upload Box Engagement**

* Add **subtle drag-and-drop animation**:

  * Hover glow around drop area
  * Pulsing cloud icon animation
* After upload → show **smooth horizontal progress bar** (Cluely-style) instead of spinner.

**Social Proof / Trust Signals**

* Add simple banner below upload:

  * *“Trusted by 500+ users in beta”*
* Placeholder area for logos (Product Hunt / Indie Hackers badges).
* Should be **dismissible** for future flexibility.

---

### 📊 Results Page

**Empty States**

* When filters remove all accounts, show centered friendly message:

  * 🎉 “Looks like no one fits that filter.”
* Optional: suggest next filter or add **“Reset filters”** button.

**Batch Actions Bar**

* Add **sticky bottom bar** that appears only when accounts are selected:

  * `Open profiles (X)` | `Copy usernames` | `Export selection`
* Hide when no accounts are selected.

**Micro-interactions**

* Grid cards:

  * Hover → soft zoom + highlight border.
* Table rows:

  * Hover → highlight row.
  * Quick action buttons (e.g., “Open profile”) appear only on hover.

**AI Assistant Enhancements (Phase 2 / Later Iteration)**

* Dynamically suggest prompts:

  * Example: if 40% of accounts are celebrities → show prompt “Hide celebrities.”
* Add **AI Tip bar** when no user interaction after 10s:

  * 💡 “Try asking me to hide celebrities or spam accounts.”

---

### 📱 Mobile

**Floating Upload CTA**

* Sticky button at bottom of homepage:

  * “Upload export”
  * On tap → scrolls to Upload box.

**AI Assistant**

* Chat bubble in bottom-right (like Intercom).
* Expands full screen on mobile → collapses back into bubble.

**Filter Bar**

* Alphabetical filter becomes **horizontally scrollable** with swipe gestures.
* Sticky at top when scrolling results.

---

### 🎨 Branding & UI polish

**Logo Animation**

* On page load, animate magnifying-glass logo with slight **pulse effect** (1.2s, ease in/out).

**Consistent Iconography**

* Switch all UI icons to **Lucide** (light stroke weight).
* Example: replace “open profile” icon with Lucide’s `ExternalLink`.

**Color Depth**

* Add **subtle gradient accents** behind metric/stat cards:

  * Radial blue (`#2563eb` at 10% opacity → transparent).
* Cards retain white base with glassy shadows.

---

## 4. Technical Requirements

* **Frontend:** Next.js + Tailwind + Framer Motion
* **Animations:** Use Framer Motion for hover, load, and logo pulse.
* **Responsive design:** All changes must adapt fluidly for mobile & desktop.
* **Accessibility:**

  * Progress bar must have ARIA role `progressbar`.
  * Ensure color contrast AA for new gradients/accents.

---

## 5. Deliverables

* Updated homepage with:

  * New CTA text
  * Upload drag/drop animation + progress loader
  * Social proof banner/logos
* Results page with:

  * Empty state messaging
  * Sticky batch actions bar
  * Micro-interactions on cards/rows
* Mobile:

  * Floating upload CTA
  * Mobile-friendly AI chat bubble
  * Scrollable alphabetical filter bar
* Branding:

Would you like me to also create a **visual wireframe sketch (section layout order + new elements placement)** so your SWE has a blueprint, not just text?
