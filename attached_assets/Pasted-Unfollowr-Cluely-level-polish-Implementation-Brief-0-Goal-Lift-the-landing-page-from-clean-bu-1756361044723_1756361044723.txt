Unfollowr — “Cluely-level polish” Implementation Brief
0) Goal

Lift the landing page from “clean but flat” to high-polish, motion-driven, brandful. Keep copy/IA the same; upgrade visual system, motion, depth, and interactivity.

1) References

Primary style reference: Cluely (screenshots provided). Emulate soft gradients, glassmorphism, subtle glows, and confident type hierarchy.

Keep Unfollowr brand: white/near-white base, dark gray text, blue CTAs.

2) Tech & Standards

Framework: Next.js + Tailwind (current stack).

Animation: Framer Motion (prefer) with whileInView for scroll reveals; fall back to reduced motion.

Icons: Lucide.

Images: Next/Image.

Lint/format: ESLint + Prettier (project defaults).

Performance budgets: LCP < 2.5s on cable 4G; CLS < 0.05; Lighthouse Perf ≥ 90.

3) Design System (Tailwind tokens)

Add to tailwind.config.js:

Colors

brand.blue: #2563eb (600), #1d4ed8 (700)

Neutrals: #0f172a (900), #111827 (800), #64748b (500)

Glass borders: white/20, fills white/30

Typography

Headline: Space Grotesk (or Geist Sans), weights 600–700

Body: Inter 400–500

Shadows

shadow-soft: 0 10px 30px -10px rgb(0 0 0 / .2)

shadow-glow: 0 0 0 1px rgb(255 255 255 / .15), 0 10px 40px -10px rgb(37 99 235 / .45)

Radii: rounded-2xl primary

Transitions: transition-all duration-200 ease-out

Load fonts via @next/font (or @fontsource) with display: swap.

4) Global Effects

Subtle background gradient on body:

bg-[radial-gradient(1200px_600px_at_50%_-100px,#e8efff,transparent)] over bg-slate-50.

Floating decorative elements (blurred blobs / file icons) absolutely positioned with a gentle float animation:

@keyframes float { 0%,100%{transform:translateY(0)} 50%{transform:translateY(-8px)} }
.float { animation: float 5s ease-in-out infinite; }


Glassmorphism utility:

<div class="bg-white/20 backdrop-blur-md border border-white/20 rounded-2xl shadow-soft">


Respect prefers-reduced-motion: disable parallax/float when set.

5) Components to Build/Refactor
A) Hero

Layout: Left = headline + subhead + primary/secondary CTAs. Right/top = floating decorative elements.

Type scale:

H1: text-6xl md:text-7xl font-bold tracking-tight

Subhead: text-xl text-slate-600 max-w-xl

CTAs:

Primary: bg-brand.blue text-white rounded-xl px-6 py-3 shadow-glow hover:scale-[1.03] hover:shadow-lg

Secondary: outline dark, subtle glow on hover

Motion:

Container: fade+rise on mount (initial {opacity:0,y:24} → inView {opacity:1,y:0})

CTAs: hover scale + shadow; focus ring ring-2 ring-brand.blue/50

B) “How it works” (3 cards)

Convert to glass cards with icon chips.

Each card animates in staggered on scroll.

Hover: slight lift -translate-y-1 + shadow-glow.

C) “Upload your export” panel

Convert to prominent glass card with soft inner glow.

Drag-and-drop highlight state (border becomes brand blue + light glow).

Show file type badges (JSON/HTML) with tooltips.

Microcopy under button: “We never store your files. Processing stays on your device.”

D) Trust/Privacy + “What’s next”

Two wide glass cards with subtle gradient underlay.

Add tiny shield/rocket icon chips with animated pulse every ~6s (reduced motion aware).

E) FAQ accordion

Smooth height animations with Framer Motion.

Chevron rotates; focus states for accessibility.

F) Sticky Header

Transparent initially; on scroll add backdrop-blur + bg-white/60 + hairline border.

Active link underline animation.

G) Footer

Add tiny byline and links; subtle gradient top border.

6) Motion Spec (Framer Motion)

Reveal pattern (default): initial {opacity:0,y:16} whileInView {opacity:1,y:0} transition {duration:.4, ease:'easeOut'} viewport {{ once:true, margin:'-80px' }}

Stagger groups: parent variants={{show:{transition:{staggerChildren:.08}}}}

Hover: scale to 1.03, shadow change; button press scale: .98.

Floating elements: CSS keyframes (see above); pause on prefers-reduced-motion.

7) Accessibility

Color contrast AA for text on translucent backgrounds (test on both light/dark parts of gradient).

Focus rings consistent and visible (ring-2 ring-brand.blue/50).

Keyboard nav through accordions and upload controls.

Motion reduction respected.

8) Performance

Inline critical CSS via Next; lazy-load heavy images.

Use next/image with priority for hero only.

Avoid large BG videos; decorative SVGs only.

Purge unused Tailwind classes.

Lighthouse target ≥ 90 across Perf/Best Practices/SEO.

9) Analytics & UX Feedback

Track: CTA clicks, DnD vs. file picker usage, FAQ opens.

Add simple scroll-depth tracking to confirm reveal timing.

10) Implementation Plan (PR slices)

Tokens & fonts (config + global styles).

Hero (structure, type, CTAs, background gradient, floating elements).

Cards (shared glass card + hover states) → apply to “How it works”, Trust/Next.

Upload panel (DnD, states, microinteractions).

FAQ (animated accordion).

Sticky header (scroll trigger, blur).

A11y + reduced-motion pass.

Perf pass + analytics.

11) Acceptance Criteria (ship checklist)

✅ Fonts load with display: swap; FOUT acceptable < 300ms.

✅ All primary sections reveal smoothly on scroll; reduced-motion disables reveals.

✅ Buttons/links have distinct hover, active, and focus states.

✅ “Upload” has DnD highlight, file badges, and success/error states.

✅ Glass cards render with subtle depth on both light and dark monitors (no muddy contrast).

✅ Sticky header transitions after 40–80px scroll; no layout shift.

✅ Lighthouse: Perf ≥ 90, Acc ≥ 95, CLS < 0.05 on mobile emulation.

✅ No console errors; animations < 60% main thread long tasks during scroll.

12) Nice-to-Have (if time)

Gradient scroll mask at fold (“Keep scrolling” hint chip).

Very light parallax on floating elements (tilt based on mouse, disabled on mobile).

Downloadable sample files to test the flow.

Themed dark mode toggle (invert glass + deepen gradients).

Notes for Engineer

Keep copy and IA as-is; this is a visual polish + interaction sprint.

Prefer composable <GlassCard> and <Reveal> utilities to reduce duplication.

Commit in small PRs with storybook/preview links for motion review.
