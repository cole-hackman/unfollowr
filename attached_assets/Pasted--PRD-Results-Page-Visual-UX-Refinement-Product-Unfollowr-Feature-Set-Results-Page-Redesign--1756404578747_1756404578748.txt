1. Objective

Align the Non-followers Results page design with the homepage‚Äôs calm, modern, and minimal aesthetic. Current layout feels too ‚Äúutility-like‚Äù with heavy whitespace, mismatched typography, and unpolished filters. This update will unify fonts, colors, spacing, and interactions across the product.
