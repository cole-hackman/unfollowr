Perfect — let’s make this a **full PRD** for revising the **Non-followers Results** page so it matches the smooth, clean polish of **Cluely.com**, while also fixing the **AI Assistant functionality**.

# 📄 PRD – Results Page Redesign + AI Assistant Fixes

**Product:** Unfollowr
**Feature Set:** Non-followers Results UI & AI Assistant
**Owner:** \[You]
**Engineering:** \[Senior SWE]

---

## 1. Objective

The Non-followers Results page currently works but feels cluttered and less polished than desired. We want it to match the **smooth, minimal, modern style of Cluely**. Additionally, the **AI Assistant isn’t functioning correctly** — filters don’t apply consistently, and UX is clunky. This update will:

* Deliver a **cleaner, calmer results UI**.
* Make the **AI Assistant functional, responsive, and trustworthy**.
* Ensure consistency with homepage polish.

---

## 2. Scope

### In Scope

* Visual redesign of results page (cards, table, metrics).
* Improved transitions/animations (Cluely-style smoothness).
* Fix AI Assistant functionality (queries → filters).
* Update action buttons (export, copy, open profiles).
* Responsive/mobile polish.

### Out of Scope

* New AI features beyond filtering/classification (covered in other PRDs).
* Backend changes outside AI pipeline.

---

## 3. Design Goals (Cluely-inspired)

* **Minimalist UI**: More white space, fewer borders, soft shadows.
* **Typography hierarchy**: Bold headers, subtle secondary text.
* **Smooth interactions**: Hover states, fade-in animations.
* **Calm palette**: Blue highlights only for CTAs; softer grays for background.
* **AI panel**: Feels integrated, not bolted-on.

---

## 4. Page Structure

### Header (Stats Bar)

* 4 metric cards (Followers, Following, Non-followers, Follow Ratio).
* Style: white glassy cards with shadow + subtle hover lift.
* Icons smaller + lighter (Cluely style).

### View Toggles

* Toggle: **Grid / Table** view.
* Smooth transition (fade/slide) between layouts.

### Actions Row

* Buttons:

  * `Export list` (primary)
  * `Open selected profiles`
  * `Copy selected`
* Simplify: keep **primary action left-aligned**, secondary smaller.

### Results List

* **Grid View**:

  * Rounded cards, centered username, `Open Profile` as subtle icon.
  * Remove alphabet strip (A–Z) unless explicitly needed — replace with **search + filter bar**.
* **Table View**:

  * Minimal rows, no heavy borders, hover highlight.
  * Two columns: Username + Actions (icon-only).

### AI Assistant Panel

* Slide-in drawer (right side).
* Default collapsed to bubble → expands smoothly on click.
* Greeting:
  *“Hi 👋 I can help you filter your results. Try asking:”*

  * Hide celebrities
  * Show real friends
  * Show spam accounts
* Input bar at bottom with rounded field + send button.

---

## 5. AI Assistant Functionality Fixes

* **Current issue**: Filters don’t apply or return 0 accounts incorrectly.
* **Fix requirements**:

  1. Ensure queries → structured filters (`segments`, `minSuggestion`, `hideFollowers`).
  2. Apply filters **instantly** to in-memory dataset.
  3. Show applied filter summary above results:

     > “Applied filters: hiding 23 celebrities, 8 brands. Showing 95 accounts.”
  4. Fallback: If AI fails, show message:
     *“Couldn’t process that query. Try: ‘Hide celebrities’ or ‘Show spam accounts.’”*

---

## 6. Technical Requirements

* Tech: Next.js + Tailwind + Framer Motion.
* Smooth transitions (fade/slide) for toggles, filters, AI panel.
* Refactor dataset handling to ensure filters apply consistently across **Grid** and **Table** view.
* AI API calls:

  * Use `/api/ai/translate-query`.
  * Temperature 0, JSON response enforced.
* Error handling: Always degrade gracefully to heuristics.

---

## 7. Deliverables

* Redesigned **Results Page** (grid + table).
* Functional **AI Assistant drawer** with working filters.
* Polished **metrics header** + simplified action bar.
* New **filter/search bar** (replaces A–Z strip).
* Responsive layouts for mobile + desktop.

---

## 8. Acceptance Criteria

* ✅ Results page has clean Cluely-style design (minimal borders, white space, soft shadows).
* ✅ Metric cards lift subtly on hover.
* ✅ Grid + Table toggle transitions smoothly.
* ✅ Search bar filters usernames instantly.
* ✅ AI Assistant drawer expands/collapses smoothly.
* ✅ Queries apply correct filters (segments, non-followers, spam).
* ✅ Applied filter summary is shown to user.
* ✅ If AI fails, error fallback appears, and baseline list remains visible.
* ✅ Page fully responsive, mobile-friendly.
* ✅ Lighthouse Perf ≥ 90, CLS < 0.05.

---

## 9. Notes

* Prioritize **clarity > density**. Users should feel calm and in control.
* Cluely reference: clean typography, glassy cards, breathing room.
* AI assistant must feel like a **helpful guide**, not an unreliable gimmick.

---

This PRD is ready for implementation — it combines **UI polish** with the **AI assistant fixes** so the results page feels as clean and smooth as the homepage.

Do you want me to also **draft exact Tailwind/React component outlines** (e.g., for the metric cards, assistant drawer, and grid cards) so your SWE has scaffolding code ready?
