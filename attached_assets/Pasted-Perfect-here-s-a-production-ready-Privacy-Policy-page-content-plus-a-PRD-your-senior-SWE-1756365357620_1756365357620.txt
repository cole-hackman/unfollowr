Perfect — here’s a **production-ready Privacy Policy** (page content) plus a **PRD** your senior SWE can act on immediately.

# 📄 Privacy Policy Page (Full Content)

```md
# Privacy Policy
_Last updated: August 28, 2025_

Unfollowr (“we,” “our,” “us”) respects your privacy. This page explains what data we handle, how we use it, and what we don’t do.

---

## 1. Local-First Design
- All of your Instagram export files are processed **directly in your browser**.  
- We do **not upload, store, or retain** your export files on our servers.  

---

## 2. Use of AI Services
To improve account classification (e.g., detecting celebrities, spam, or friends), we sometimes send **minimal text snippets** from your export (such as usernames, display names, or bios) to **Google Gemini**, an AI model provided by Google.

- These snippets are used **only for classification**.  
- Gemini does **not use this data to train models**.  
- We do **not have access** to the transmitted data beyond what Gemini returns.  
- No raw export files (followers/following lists) are sent.  

---

## 3. What We Don’t Do
- We do **not** sell your data.  
- We do **not** build profiles on you.  
- We do **not** share your files with third parties.  
- We do **not** retain any personal data after your session ends.  

---

## 4. Anonymous Analytics (Optional)
We may collect **anonymous usage statistics** (like total number of uploads or how many accounts are classified as “celebrities”) to improve Unfollowr.

- These analytics never include usernames, bios, or export files.  
- You can opt out at any time.  

---

## 5. Your Control
- You can use Unfollowr fully without enabling AI features.  
- You may opt in/out of AI assist and anonymous analytics at any time.  
- Clearing your browser cache deletes all local data.  

---

## 6. Changes
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any significant changes will be clearly posted here with an updated date.

---

## 7. Contact
If you have questions, reach out:  
📧 support@unfollowr.app  

---

**Your data belongs to you. We’ll never store it — period.**

# 📌 PRD: Privacy Policy Page

**Feature:** Privacy Policy Page
**Product:** Unfollowr
**Owner:** \[You]
**Engineering:** \[Senior SWE]

---

## 1. Objective

Provide a dedicated **/privacy** page that transparently explains how Unfollowr handles user data, reinforcing trust and compliance with privacy expectations.

---

## 2. Scope

* Implement a static `/privacy` route/page.
* Display the Privacy Policy (content above).
* Ensure it is **linked prominently**:

  * Footer navigation (e.g., “Privacy Policy”).
  * Consent modals/settings panels (link to “Read our Privacy Policy”).
* Style: consistent with site (Next.js + Tailwind).
* SEO: Add `<title>Privacy Policy | Unfollowr</title>` and description meta tag.

---

## 3. Requirements

### Functional

* Page must render all sections clearly (headings, paragraphs, lists).
* Must support mobile and desktop viewports.
* Links (e.g., `mailto:support@unfollowr.app`) must be clickable.

### Non-functional

* Accessibility: headings follow semantic order (h1 → h2 → h3).
* Performance: page loads instantly (static).
* No client-side API calls; fully static render.

---

## 4. Deliverables

* `/pages/privacy.tsx` (Next.js) with Tailwind-styled content.
* Footer link → `/privacy`.
* Update `ConsentModal` or AI assist toggle to include link: *“Read our Privacy Policy”*.

---

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

* ✅ `/privacy` renders complete text (sections 1–7).
* ✅ Footer includes a visible link to `/privacy`.
* ✅ Consent modals/settings include link to `/privacy`.
* ✅ Content matches exactly the Privacy Policy provided above.
* ✅ Page is mobile responsive and readable.
* ✅ All text is selectable and accessible to screen readers.
* ✅ SEO metadata is present.

---

This PRD is **ready for instant implementation** — just drop in the content, style with Tailwind, and hook into nav + settings.

Want me to also write the **short homepage “AI + Privacy” microcopy** that your SWE can slot under the new ✨ AI badge so it matches the policy but stays simple?
