Perfect — thanks for the screenshot. You’re right: right now the results page is functional but not **engaging**. To match the polish of **Cluely.com**, we need better **filters, interactivity, and AI accessibility**. Here’s a PRD your senior SWE can act on:

---

# 📄 PRD – Results Page Improvements (Filters + AI Assistant Integration)

**Product:** Unfollowr
**Feature Set:** Results Page Redesign (Filters, AI, Interactivity)
**Owner:** \[You]
**Engineering:** \[Senior SWE]

---

## 1. Objective

Make the **Non-followers Results page** more engaging, polished, and useful. Right now it feels static and lacks discoverability of AI. This update will:

* Add **alphabetical and advanced filters**.
* Reintroduce the **AI Assistant** as a visible chat entrypoint.
* Improve **UI polish** (spacing, cards, animations) to feel as smooth as Cluely.

---

## 2. Scope

### In Scope

* Alphabetical filter bar (A–Z + `#`).
* New **filter button** for segment/criteria filters.
* Visible floating AI Assistant chat icon with quick-start suggestions.
* UI polish (spacing, typography, hover states, reveal animations).
* Filter + AI integration with existing dataset.

### Out of Scope

* New AI functionality (stick to classification + filters already scoped).
* Full redesign of export/report flow.

---

## 3. Features & Requirements

### A) Header Stats Bar

* Keep existing metrics (Followers, Following, Non-followers, Ratio).
* Style to be **lighter, smoother** (glassy cards, subtle shadow).
* Add hover animation (lift + glow).

---

### B) Filters

#### Alphabetical Filter

* Horizontal scroll bar (sticky) showing **A–Z + #**.
* Clicking filters accounts to only show usernames starting with that letter.
* Active letter styled in **blue highlight**.

#### Advanced Filter Button

* New **“Filters” button** (next to “Export list” / “Open profiles”).
* On click → opens side panel or dropdown with options:

  * Segment: Celebrity, Friend, Spam, Unknown.
  * Non-follower toggle.
  * Suggestion score (slider 0–1).
  * Inactive only (if data available).
* Apply/Reset actions at bottom.

---

### C) AI Assistant

* Bring back **AI Assistant** as a **floating chat icon** in bottom-right corner.
* Icon: blue speech bubble (prominent but not overwhelming).
* On click → slide-in drawer (right side).
* Drawer content:

  * Greeting:

    > “👋 Hi, I can help filter your results. Try asking:”

    * “Hide celebrities”
    * “Show spam accounts”
    * “Show real friends who don’t follow back”
  * Input bar at bottom with rounded send button.
* Results update instantly when filters applied.
* Applied filters summary above results:

  > “Applied filters: hiding 23 celebrities, 10 spam accounts. Showing 93 accounts.”

---

### D) Results Grid & Table

* Grid view:

  * Rounded cards, centered username, hover glow.
  * Profile link → small external icon.
  * Checkbox in top-right corner.
* Table view:

  * Cleaner rows, no heavy borders, hover highlight.
  * Actions column simplified to single icon.
* Add subtle fade-in for accounts on load/filter change.

---

### E) Search

* Keep search bar.
* Ensure it works **with filters and AI results combined**.

---

## 4. Technical Requirements

* Next.js + Tailwind + Framer Motion.
* Add Alphabetical filter → client-side filter of in-memory dataset.
* Filter side panel → client-side filtering (combine with AI filters).
* Floating AI icon → new component `<AIChatLauncher />`.
* AI integration:

  * `/api/ai/translate-query` for natural-language → filter JSON.
  * Temperature 0, JSON output enforced.
* State management: centralize dataset + active filters (Zustand or Context).

---

## 5. Deliverables

* Redesigned Results page with:

  * Alphabetical filter bar.
  * Advanced filter button + side panel.
  * Floating AI Assistant chat icon + drawer.
  * Polished Grid + Table layouts.
  * Updated stat cards.
* Fully responsive design.

---

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

* ✅ Alphabetical filter bar works (A–Z).
* ✅ Clicking “Filters” opens side panel with segment, score, non-follower toggles.
* ✅ Floating AI Assistant visible on all results screens.
* ✅ AI Assistant drawer opens with suggestions + input bar.
* ✅ Queries apply filters correctly (e.g., “Hide celebrities” removes celeb accounts).
* ✅ Applied filter summary visible above results.
* ✅ Grid + Table toggle works with filters active.
* ✅ Search works with filters + AI combined.
* ✅ Page feels polished: hover states, smooth transitions, responsive design.
* ✅ Lighthouse Perf ≥ 90, CLS < 0.05.

## 7. Notes

* Inspiration: **Cluely’s results pages** (calm, interactive, clear hierarchy).
* Priority: **Make the page fun to use**, not just functional.
* AI should feel **accessible + helpful**, not hidden.

---

⚡ This PRD gives your SWE everything needed to make the results page **as smooth and engaging as Cluely’s**, while fixing discoverability of AI and adding useful filters.

---

Do you want me to also draft **mock Tailwind/React component scaffolds** for:

* Alphabetical filter bar
* Floating AI chat launcher
* Filter side panel

…so your SWE has code starting points?
