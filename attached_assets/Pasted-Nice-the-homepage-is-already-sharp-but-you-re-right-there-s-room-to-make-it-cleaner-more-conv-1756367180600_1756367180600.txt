Nice — the homepage is already sharp, but you’re right: there’s **room to make it cleaner, more conversion-focused, and aligned with user intent**. The biggest win will be **moving the Upload box near the top**, since that’s the core action. Let’s formalize this into a PRD.

# 📄 PRD – Homepage Refinement & Upload Placement

**Product:** Unfollowr
**Feature Set:** Homepage UX & Layout Improvements
**Owner:** \[You]
**Engineering:** \[Senior SWE]

---

## 1. Objective

Refine the homepage so it:

* **Prioritizes the upload action** (move “Upload your export” higher).
* Improves **readability and flow** (less scrolling before core action).
* Balances benefit-driven messaging with trust signals (privacy + AI features).
* Feels cleaner and smoother, closer to Cluely’s polished vibe.

---

## 2. Scope

### In Scope

* Reorder homepage sections (Upload moved near top).
* Copy and visual refinements.
* Layout adjustments for hierarchy.
* Minor style polish (spacing, typography, hover states).

### Out of Scope

* New AI features (already scoped in Results PRD).
* Backend/API changes.

---

## 3. Page Structure (Revised)

### Hero (top of page)

* Keep **✨ New: AI Features** badge.
* **Headline:**
  *“Clean up your following in minutes.”*
* **Subhead:**
  *“Smarter suggestions, easy filters, and a private assistant to help you tidy up faster.”*
* **CTA Button:**
  Primary: `Upload my export` (scrolls user directly to upload box).
  Secondary: `See what’s new`.

---

### Upload Section (moved up — directly under Hero)

* Position upload card **immediately after hero**, before “Smarter insights.”
* Card:

  * Title: “Upload your export”
  * Subtext: “We don’t store your files. Processing is session-based and ephemeral.”
  * Upload box styled prominently (glass card + drop shadow).
  * Privacy reassurance (green badge + lock icon):
    ✅ “Private: Files never leave your device without your consent.”
* CTA under upload box:

  * Primary: `Analyze non-followers` (blue)
  * Secondary: `Try with sample files` (ghost button)
  * Text link: `Clear all`

---

### Insights Section

* Heading: “Smarter insights”
* Subhead: *“Unfollowr helps you spot who matters, who’s inactive, and who’s just noise.”*
* Feature cards: Smart Groups, Assistant, Clear Suggestions.
* Keep “Built with Google AI” badge.

---

### How it Works

* Keep 3-step layout: Upload → We sort & analyze → Decide easily.
* Update copy slightly for clarity (shorter, friendlier).

---

### Privacy & What’s Next

* Keep privacy-first card.
* Add stronger privacy reassurance with **short tagline**:
  *“Your files stay private. Always.”*
* Keep What’s Next roadmap.

---

### FAQ

* Keep existing Qs.
* Add:

  * **“Why is the upload box near the top?”**
    *Because uploading is the first step. We want to make it fast and easy to get started.*

---

## 4. Visual / Interaction Improvements

1. **Spacing & hierarchy**

   * More breathing room around hero and upload card.
   * Reduce dense text.
2. **Typography**

   * Keep current font but lighten supporting text color (use `text-slate-600`).
3. **Hover states**

   * Buttons: slight scale + shadow on hover.
   * Cards: soft lift hover.
4. **Smooth transitions**

   * Fade/slide for each section reveal (Framer Motion).

---

## 5. Technical Requirements

* Next.js + Tailwind + Framer Motion.
* Upload card moved up without breaking navigation links.
* “Upload my export” button in Hero scrolls to upload card (`scrollIntoView`).
* Ensure responsive design works (mobile-first).
* Lighthouse perf/accessibility scores remain ≥ 90.

---

## 6. Deliverables

* Homepage with new order: Hero → Upload → Insights → How it works → Privacy → FAQ.
* Upload box styled prominently + reassurance badge.
* Updated CTAs.
* Light copy refinements.
* Section animations.

---

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

* ✅ Upload card appears directly under Hero.
* ✅ Hero CTA scrolls smoothly to upload card.
* ✅ Upload card has privacy reassurance badge.
* ✅ Page reads in benefit-driven order (upload first, insights second).
* ✅ Hover and reveal animations working.
* ✅ All content is responsive and mobile-friendly.
* ✅ Performance maintained.

---

## 8. Notes

* Priority is **conversion** (upload first).
* Language must stay **clear + approachable**, not AI-heavy.
* Visual vibe: clean, light, trustworthy → less clutter, more clarity.

⚡This PRD is ready for implementation — your SWE just needs to restructure components and update copy/styles accordingly.

Do you want me to **mock up a new wireframe layout in Figma-style (boxes/sections with annotations)** so your SWE has a clear visual reference for how the homepage should flow after moving upload up?
