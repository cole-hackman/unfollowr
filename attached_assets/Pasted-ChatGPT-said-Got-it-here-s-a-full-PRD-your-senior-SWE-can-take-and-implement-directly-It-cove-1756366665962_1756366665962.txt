3. Content Updates
Hero Section

Keep “✨ New: AI Features” badge.

Headline:
Clean up your following in minutes. (unchanged)

Subhead:
“Now smarter than ever — clearer suggestions, easy filters, and a new assistant to help you tidy up faster. Upload your Instagram export to discover who doesn’t follow you back.”

CTA Buttons:

Primary: Analyze my Instagram

Secondary: What’s new

“Smarter Analysis” Section

Heading:
Change from Smarter analysis → Smarter insights

Subhead:
“Unfollowr helps you spot who matters, who’s inactive, and who’s just noise.”

Feature Cards:

Smart Groups
Automatically sorts accounts into Celebrities, Friends, Spam, and more.

Assistant
Type or tap a question — like “Hide celebrities” or “Show real friends” — and the assistant filters instantly.

Clear Suggestions
See not just who doesn’t follow back, but why they’re suggested for removal.

“How it works” Section

Change steps:

Upload — Add your Instagram files (JSON/HTML).

We sort & analyze — Accounts grouped with extra insights.

Decide easily — See clear suggestions and open profiles directly.

Upload Section

Add privacy reassurance badge under upload box:
✅ Private: Files never leave your device without your consent.

Add lock icon (Tailwind + Lucide Lock icon).

FAQ Section

Additions:

Does this work on mobile and desktop?
Yes. Unfollowr is fully responsive — you can upload and analyze your Instagram export on both phones and computers.

Do I need to log in with Instagram?
No. You only upload your exported files. We never ask for your password or login.

How long does processing take?
Usually under a minute, depending on the size of your export.

Can I delete my data?
All processing is local. Closing the tab or clearing your cache removes everything.

4. Visual & Interaction Enhancements

FAQ hover/expand state

Add bg-slate-50 hover background.

Smooth expand/collapse transition (Framer Motion).

Info Cards (Privacy First / What’s next)

Add subtle fade-in on scroll using <Reveal /> component.

Trust Signal

Add “Built with Google AI” badge under “Smarter insights” section.

Small text: “Powered by Gemini AI for fast, reliable classification.”

5. Technical Requirements

Tech stack: Next.js + Tailwind + Framer Motion (already in use).

Responsive design — ensure new FAQ items and lock badge scale on mobile.

Use Lucide icons for lock and Google AI badge (or custom SVG if needed).

Lighthouse performance, accessibility, and SEO scores must remain ≥ 90.

6. Deliverables

Updated homepage copy (hero, features, how it works, FAQ).

New FAQ items added.

Privacy reassurance badge in upload card.

Hover/transition polish for FAQ + cards.

Trust badge under “Smarter insights.”

7. Acceptance Criteria

✅ Hero section shows new subhead and updated CTAs.

✅ Feature section heading updated to “Smarter insights” with revised card text.

✅ Upload card has privacy reassurance badge with lock icon.

✅ FAQ includes new questions/answers (mobile support, login, speed, privacy).

✅ FAQ hover/expand has smooth animation.

✅ “Built with Google AI” badge visible under features.

✅ No regressions on mobile responsiveness.

✅ Lighthouse Perf, Acc, SEO ≥ 90.

8. Notes

Keep tone approachable, benefit-driven, and trust-focused.

AI should be visible but not overwhelming — “smarter” and “insights” are the framing words.

Privacy reassurance is critical — must be visible in multiple spots.

This PRD is ready for immediate implementation.
