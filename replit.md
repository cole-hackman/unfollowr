## Data Flow

1. **User Upload**: Users upload two JSON files (followers and following exports)
2. **File Validation**: Server validates file extensions and size limits
3. **JSON Parsing**: Extract usernames from Instagram's export format
4. **Set Operations**: Compare following vs followers to find non-followers
5. **Results Display**: Present statistics and searchable list of non-followers
6. **Error Handling**: Display user-friendly error messages for invalid data

## External Dependencies

  - **Following Export**: HTML document with Instagram profile links and user data

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
